# Python

- Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

- It is used for:
  - web development (server-side)
  - software development
  - mathematics
  - system scripting

- The syntax of python is very close to that of english language.

## Variables

- We need not declare variables with datatypes as we do in other languages.
- Variables are created when we assign values to them.
- we can get the tye of the variables using the type() functioon.

```python
x=1
print(type(x))
```

Output:

- Variable names in python are case sensative, i.e., a and A are different in python.

### Variable Names

- A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

- Rules for Python variables:

  - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
  - A variable name cannot start with a number.
  - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
  - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
  - A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
 
### Multi Words Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

#### Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
```python
myVariableName = "John"
```
#### Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:
```python
MyVariableName = "John"
```
#### Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:
```python
my_variable_name = "John"
```
